# Build
- No external packages needed, just download and run the project :)

# Further Considerations
- I ran out of time towards the end, and was unable to fully test the keychain storage for the login screen. 


If I had more time, I would have implemented:
- Preview of what the camera sees when taking screen shots to provide more responsiveness to the user. 
- Implemented some onSuccess functions that would alert the user to the progress of the application.
- implemented touch id (also couldn't implement this, because my phones home/touch-id button is broken :( ).
- more verbose error handling for both controllers.
- spent more time looking for different options for securing the image data including looking at different cocoapods already avaliable
- more testing
- ui/ux fixes (getting rid of the navigation controller bar, adding a logout button, logging out on viewDidDissapear, etc)
